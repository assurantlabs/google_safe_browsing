----------------------

##Installation

Install the gem

    gem install google_safe_browsing

Or add it to your Gemfile

    #Gemfile

    ...

    gem 'google_safe_browsing'

Then, generate the migration and run it

    $ rails generate google_safe_browsing:install
        create db/migrate/20120227143535_create_google_safe_browsing_tables.rb
    $ rake db:migrate


Add your Google Safe Browsing API key to congif/application.rb
You can get a key from the [Google Safe Browsing website](http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/key_signup.html)

    #config/application.rb

    ...

    config.google_safe_browsing.api_key = 'MySuperAwesomeKey5124'


## Rake Tasks

You can run an update manually

    $ rake google_safe_browsing:update

Or, if you have [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) and 
[Resque Scheduler](https://github.com/bvandenbos/resque-scheduler) set up, you can 
run an update and automatically schedule another update based on the 'next polling 
interval' parameter from the API

    $ rake google_safe_browsing:update_and_reschedule

## Usage

To programatically run an update in your app

    GoogleSafeBrowsing::APIv2.update

Note: This can take a while, especially when first seeding your database. I wouldn't recommend
calling this in a controller for a normal page request.

To check a url for badness

    GoogleSafeBrowsing::APIv2.lookup('http://bad.url.address.here.com.edu/forProfit')

The url string parameter does not have to be any specific format or Canonicalization the Google
Safe Browsing gem will handle all of that for you. Please report any errors from a weirdly formatted 
url though. I most likely have missed some cases.

The `lookup` method returns a string ( either 'malware' or 'phishing' ) for the name of the black list
which the url appears on, or `nil` if the url is not on Google's list.
